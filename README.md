You will be required to submit a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  


You should include a README.md in the repo describing how the script works and the code book describing the variables.

I was able to follow the README in the directory that explained what the analysis files did.
